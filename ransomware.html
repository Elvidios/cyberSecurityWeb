            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12 py-4">
                    <p class="text-light">Ransomware is a type of malware that holds a victim’s sensitive data or device hostage, threatening to keep it locked—or worse—unless the victim pays a ransom to the attacker.</p>
                    <p class="text-light">20% of all cyberattacks recorded by the IBM® X-Force® Threat Intelligence Index in 2023 involved ransomware. And these attacks move quickly. When hackers gain access to a network, it takes less than four days to deploy ransomware. This speed gives organizations little time to detect and thwart potential attacks.</p>
                    <p class="text-light">Ransomware victims and negotiators are reluctant to disclose ransom payments, but threat actors often demand seven-figure and eight-figure amounts. And ransom payments are only part of the total cost of a ransomware infection. According to the IBM Cost of a Data Breach report, the average cost of a ransomware breach is USD 5.68 million, which does not include ransom payments.</p>
                    <p class="text-light">That said, cybersecurity teams are becoming more adept at combatting ransomware. The X-Force Threat Intelligence Index found that ransomware infections declined by 11.5% between 2022 and 2023, likely due to improvements in threat detection and prevention.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12 py-4">
                    <p class="text-light">There are two general types of ransomware. The most common type, called encrypting ransomware or crypto ransomware, holds the victim’s data hostage by encrypting it. The attacker then demands a ransom in exchange for providing the encryption key needed to decrypt the data.</p>
                    <p class="text-light">The less common form of ransomware, called non-encrypting ransomware or screen-locking ransomware, locks the victim’s entire device, usually by blocking access to the operating system. Instead of starting up as usual, the device displays a screen that makes the ransom demand</p>
                    <p class="text-light">These two general types fall into these subcategories:</p>

                        <div class="col-md-12 py-4">
                            <p class="text-light">Leakware or doxware is ransomware that steals, or exfiltrates, sensitive data and threatens to publish it. While earlier forms of leakware or doxware often stole data without encrypting it, today’s variants usually do both.</p>

                        <p class="text-light">Mobile ransomware includes all ransomware that affects mobile devices. Delivered through malicious apps or drive-by downloads, most mobile ransomware is non-encrypting ransomware. Hackers prefer screen-lockers for mobile attacks because automated cloud data backups, standard on many mobile devices, make it easy to reverse encryption attacks.</p>

                        <p class="text-light">Wipers, or destructive ransomware, threaten to destroy data if the victim does not pay the ransom. In some cases, the ransomware destroys the data even if the victim pays. This latter type of wiper is often deployed by nation-state actors or hacktivists rather than common cybercriminals.</p>

                        <p class="text-light">Scareware is just what it sounds like—ransomware that tries to scare users into paying a ransom. Scareware might pose as a message from a law enforcement agency, accusing the victim of a crime and demanding a fine. Alternatively, it might spoof a legitimate virus infection alert, encouraging the victim to purchase ransomware disguised as antivirus software.</p>
                        <p class="text-light">Sometimes, the scareware is the ransomware, encrypting the data or locking the device. In other cases, it’s the ransomware vector, encrypting nothing but coercing the victim to download ransomware.</p>

                        <p class="text-light">Social engineering attacks trick victims into downloading and running executable files that turn out to be ransomware. For example, a phishing email might contain a malicious attachment disguised as a harmless-looking .pdf, Microsoft Word document, or other file.</p>
                        <p class="text-light">Social engineering attacks might also lure users into visiting a malicious website or scanning malicious QR codes that pass the ransomware through the user’s web browser.</p>

                        <p class="text-light">Zero-day vulnerabilities, which are vulnerabilities either unknown to the security community or identified but not yet patched, pose a particular threat. Some ransomware gangs buy information on zero-day flaws from other hackers to plan their attacks. Hackers have also effectively used patched vulnerabilities as attack vectors, as was the case in the 2017 WannaCry attack.</p>

                            <li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light">Implementing access control policies including multifactor authentication, network segmentation and similar measures can prevent ransomware from reaching sensitive data. Identity and access management (IAM) controls can also keep cryptoworms from spreading to other devices on the network.</li>
                            <li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light">Formal incident response plans enable security teams to intercept and remediate breaches in less time. The Cost of a Data Breach report found that organizations with formal plans and dedicated incident response teams identify breaches 54 days faster than organizations that have neither. This speedier detection time lowers remediation costs, saving organizations an average of nearly USD 1 million.</li>
