        <h4 class="text-light pb-3" style="text-align: left;">What is a DoS Attack?</h4>
        <div class="col-md-12 py-4">
            <p class="text-light">A denial of service (DoS) attack is an attempt to overload a website or network, with the aim of degrading its performance or even making it completely inaccessible.</p>
            <p class="text-light">Typically a successful DoS attack will result in loss of availability of part, or all, of a system, and consume time and money to analyse, defend and recover from.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12 py-4">
            <h5 class="text-light">DDoS attacks</h5>
            <p class="text-light">A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is a form of DoS attack that originates from more than one source. DDoS attacks are typically more effective than attacks from a single source because they usually generate more attacking traffic. The fact that traffic is spread across many sources also makes it harder to distinguish attacker traffic from legitimate traffic. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12 py-4">
            <h5 class="text-light">What is the impact?</h5>
            <p class="text-light">DoS attacks can easily be targeted against your network, system or service and remain a credible and prevalent threat.</p>
            <p class="text-light">Different types of DoS attack target different parts of a system – for instance, a DoS attack can target a network's capacity to send and receive traffic (its bandwidth), or the processor limitations of servers. The overall impact depends on what is targeted, how long the attack lasts and the effectiveness of your organisational response plan.</p>
            <p class="text-light">Whatever the type of attack, if successful, it will cause the targeted system to become unreliable or unresponsive to a user trying to access it.</p>
            <p class="text-light">For an organisation, an unavailable public-facing website can have a significant impact on an organisation's productivity if it affects business-critical functions. This could include loss of sales, or employees unable to work. This is the case even if an attack is temporary, with no effect on data confidentiality or integrity.</p>

        <div class="container-fluid-center bg-black" style="border-radius: 10px;">           
            <h4 class="text-light pb-3" style="text-align: left;">Mitigating a DDoS attack</h4>    
            <div class="col-md-12 py-4">
                <p class="text-light">DDoS protection solutions help detect traffic anomalies and determine whether they are innocent or malicious. After all, a sudden flood of requests might be the result of a successful marketing campaign, and blocking those requests might be a business disaster.</p>
                <p class="text-light">DDoS mitigation efforts typically attempt to divert the flow of malicious traffic as quickly as possible. </p>
                <p class="text-light">Common DDoS prevention and mitigation efforts include:</p>
            </div>               
            <div class="col-md-12 py-4">
                <h5 class="text-light">-Web application firewalls (WAFs)</h5>
                <p class="text-light">While standard firewalls protect networks at the port level, WAFs help ensure that requests are safe before forwarding them to web servers. A WAF can determine which types of requests are legitimate and which are not, enabling it to drop malicious traffic and prevent application-layer attacks.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-12 py-4">
                <h5 class="text-light">-Content delivery networks (CDNs)</h5>
                <p class="text-light">A CDN is a network of distributed servers that can help users access online services more quickly and reliably. With a CDN in place, users' requests don't travel all the way back to the service's origin server. Instead, requests are routed to a geographically closer CDN server that delivers the content.</p>
                <p class="text-light">CDNs can help protect against DDoS attacks by increasing a service's overall capacity for traffic. When a CDN server is taken down by a DDoS attack, user traffic can be routed to other available server resources in the network.</p>

        <div class="col-md-12 py-4">
            <p class="text-light">Endpoint detection and response (EDR), network detection and response (NDR) and other tools can monitor network infrastructure for indicators of compromise. When these systems see possible DDoS signs—such as abnormal traffic patterns—they can trigger real-time incident responses, such as terminating suspicious network connections.</p>

            <h4 class="text-light pb-3" style="text-align: left;">Advanced DDoS Response Techniques</h4>    
            <div class="col-md-12 py-4">
                <p class="text-light">Modern DDoS defense requires a multi-layered approach that combines various techniques to identify, filter, and mitigate malicious traffic while maintaining service availability for legitimate users.</p>
                <p class="text-light">Effective DDoS response strategies typically implement several complementary methods:</p>
            </div>               
            
            <div class="col-md-12 py-4">
                <h5 class="text-light">-Blackhole routing</h5>
                <p class="text-light">A "black hole" is part of a network where incoming traffic is deleted without being processed or stored. Blackhole routing means diverting incoming traffic to a black hole when a DDoS attack is suspected.</p>
                <p class="text-light">The downside is that blackhole routing can discard the good with the bad. Valid and perhaps valuable traffic might also be thrown away, making blackhole routing a simple but blunt instrument in the face of an attack.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="col-md-12 py-4">
                <h5 class="text-light">-Rate limiting</h5>
                <p class="text-light">Rate limiting means placing limits on the number of incoming requests a server is allowed to accept during a set time period. Service might also slow for legitimate users, but the server is not overwhelmed.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="col-md-12 py-4">
                <h5 class="text-light">-Load balancing</h5>
                <p class="text-light">Load balancing is the process of distributing network traffic among multiple servers to optimize application availability. Load balancing can help defend against DDoS attacks by automatically routing traffic away from overwhelmed servers.</p>
                <p class="text-light">Organizations can install hardware- or software-based load balancers to process traffic. They can also use anycast networking, which enables a single IP address to be assigned to several servers or nodes across multiple locations so that traffic can be shared across those servers. Normally, a request is sent to the optimal server. As traffic increases, the load is spread out, meaning that the servers are less apt to be overwhelmed.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="col-md-12 py-4">
                <h5 class="text-light">-Traffic scrubbing</h5>
                <p class="text-light">Scrubbing centers are specialized networks or services that can filter malicious traffic from legitimate traffic by using techniques such as traffic authentication and anomaly detection. Scrubbing centers block malicious traffic while allowing the legitimate traffic to reach its destination.</p>
