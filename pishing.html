                <p class="text-light">Scammers use email or text messages to trick you into giving them your personal and financial information. But there are several ways to protect yourself.</p>
                <p class="text-light">Scammers often update their tactics to keep up with the latest news or trends, but here are some common tactics used in phishing emails or text messages:</p>
                <p class="text-light">Phishing emails and text messages often tell a story to trick you into clicking on a link or opening an attachment. You might get an unexpected email or text message that looks like it’s from a company you know or trust, like a bank or a credit card or utility company. Or maybe it’s from an online payment website or app.</p>

                <br>
                <p class="text-light">Because phishing scams target individuals, employees are often an organization's first and last line of defense against these attacks. Organizations can teach users how to recognize the signs of phishing attempts and how to respond to suspicious emails and text messages. This can include giving employees easy ways to report phishing attempts to the IT or security team.</p>
                <p class="text-light">Organizations can also establish policies and practices that make it difficult for attackers to succeed.</p>
                <p class="text-light">For example, organizations may prohibit initiating money transfers by e-mail. They can require employees to verify requests for money or information by contacting the requester by means other than those provided in the message. For example, employees can type a URL directly into their browser instead of clicking on a link or call a colleague's office line instead of responding to a text message from an unknown number.</p>

                <div class="container-fluid-center bg-dark" style="border-radius: 10px;">
                <p class="text-light">-Spam filters and email security software use data about existing phishing scams and machine learning algorithms to identify phishing emails and other spam messages. Scams and spam are moved to a separate folder, where malicious links and code are eradicated.</p>
                <p class="text-light">-Antivirus and anti-malware software can detect and neutralize malicious files or code carried by phishing emails.</p>
                <p class="text-light">-Multifactor authentication can prevent hackers from taking over user accounts. Cybercriminals using phishing can steal passwords, but it is much harder for them to steal a second factor, such as a fingerprint scanner or one-time passcode.</p>
                <p class="text-light">-Enterprise cybersecurity solutions, such as security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) and security information and event management (SIEM) platforms, use AI and automation to detect and respond to anomalous activity. These solutions can help stop phishers attempting to install malware or take over accounts.</p>
                <p class="text-light">-Web filters prevent users from visiting known malicious websites and display alerts whenever users visit suspicious pages. These tools can help mitigate damage if a user clicks on a phishing link.</p>
